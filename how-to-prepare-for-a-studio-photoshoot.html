 <p class="intro-text">
  Preparing for a studio photoshoot doesn’t have to be stressful.
  Whether it’s your first time or you’ve done it before, proper preparation
  plays a major role in how confident, relaxed, and natural you appear in
  your final images.
</p>


  <div class="blog-card">
    <h3>1. Choose the Right Outfit</h3>
    <p>
      Your clothing choice greatly affects the final look of your photos.
      Solid colors, neutral tones, and well-fitted outfits work best under
      studio lighting. Avoid busy patterns, loud prints, and visible logos,
      as they can distract attention from your face and expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re unsure, bring multiple outfit options. Your photographer
      can help you select what complements the lighting, background, and
      mood of the shoot.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-card">
    <h3>2. Get Enough Rest and Hydration</h3>
    <p>
      A good night’s sleep before your shoot helps reduce eye bags,
      skin dullness, and fatigue. Well-rested clients look fresher,
      more alert, and photograph more naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drink enough water the day before and avoid alcohol or excessive
      caffeine. Hydrated skin reflects light better and gives your
      portraits a healthy glow.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-card">
    <h3>3. Grooming and Makeup</h3>
    <p>
      Grooming is essential, even for casual portraits. Clean hair,
      trimmed facial hair, and light makeup go a long way in creating
      a polished appearance without looking overdone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Makeup should enhance your natural features rather than mask them.
      For professional shoots, consider light foundation, subtle eye work,
      and natural lip tones.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-card">
    <h3>4. Relax and Trust the Photographer</h3>
    <p>
      You don’t need to know how to pose — that’s part of our job.
      Professional photographers guide you through poses, angles,
      and expressions that suit your body type and personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relax, breathe, and enjoy the process. The more comfortable you feel,
      the more authentic and powerful your images will be.
