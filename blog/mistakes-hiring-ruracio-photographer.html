    <p>
      Hiring the right photographer for a Ruracio ceremony is extremely important.
      Unlike other events, Ruracio ceremonies involve deep cultural traditions,
      elders, and sensitive moments that cannot be repeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, many families make avoidable mistakes when choosing a
      Ruracio photographer. This guide highlights the most common mistakes
      and how to avoid them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Hiring a Ruracio Photographer Without Cultural Experience</h2>

    <p>
      Not all photographers understand Kenyan cultural ceremonies.
      A photographer without Ruracio experience may miss important moments
      or behave inappropriately around elders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Always choose a photographer who understands cultural flow and
      respects traditional practices.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Prioritizing Price Over Quality</h2>

    <p>
      While budget matters, choosing the cheapest option can lead to poor
      image quality, missed moments, and disappointment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ruracio ceremonies cannot be repeated, making professional quality
      a worthwhile investment.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Not Discussing Ceremony Flow in Advance</h2>

    <p>
      Every Ruracio ceremony follows a unique structure guided by elders.
      Failing to brief the photographer in advance can lead to confusion
      and missed key moments.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ignoring Editing Quality and Deliverables</h2>

    <p>
      Some photographers focus only on shooting and neglect post-production.
      Professional editing ensures colors, skin tones, and cultural details
      are preserved accurately.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Booking Without a Clear Agreement</h2>

    <p>
      Always confirm what is included in your package: coverage duration,
      delivery timeline, and final outputs. A clear agreement prevents
      misunderstandings.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Choose the Right Ruracio Photographer</h2>

    <p>
      The right photographer combines cultural understanding, technical skill,
      professionalism, and clear communication.
