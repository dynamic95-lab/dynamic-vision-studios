  <p>
    Hiring the wrong Ruracio photographer can result in missed cultural moments,
    poor image quality, and unnecessary stress. This guide explains the most
    common mistakes families make in Kenya — and how to avoid them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike other events, Ruracio ceremonies involve deep cultural traditions,
    elders, and sensitive moments that cannot be repeated. Choosing the right
    photographer is essential to preserving these memories respectfully.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Hiring a Photographer Without Cultural Experience</h2>

  <p>
    Not all photographers understand Kenyan cultural ceremonies.
    A photographer without Ruracio experience may miss important moments
    or behave inappropriately around elders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Always choose a photographer who understands ceremony flow and
    respects traditional practices.

  <h2>2. Prioritizing Price Over Quality</h2>

  <p>
    While budget matters, choosing the cheapest option can lead to poor
    image quality, missed moments, and long-term disappointment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ruracio ceremonies cannot be repeated, making professional quality
    a worthwhile investment.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Not Discussing Ceremony Flow in Advance</h2>

  <p>
    Every Ruracio ceremony follows a unique structure guided by elders.
    Failing to brief the photographer in advance can lead to confusion
    and missed key moments.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Ignoring Editing Quality and Deliverables</h2>

  <p>
    Some photographers focus only on shooting and neglect post-production.
    Professional editing ensures colors, skin tones, and cultural details
    are preserved accurately.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Booking Without a Clear Agreement</h2>

  <p>
    Always confirm what is included in your package: coverage duration,
    delivery timeline, and final outputs. A clear agreement prevents
    misunderstandings.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Choose the Right Ruracio Photographer</h2>

  <p>
    The right photographer combines cultural understanding, technical skill,
    professionalism, and clear communication.
